      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>That first picture you see of me is from when I graduated with honors as Magna Cum Laude at Florida International University.
        A rather important side note is that I majored in Nursing Science!
        I worked hard and quickly became a proficient and empathetic healthcare professional.
        Despite being successful in a great career, there was something missing. I craved something more, something <em>different</em>.
        After a nudge from my techie brother, I decided to go online and learn about coding.
        It was love at first line. This was it. This is what I had been looking for. I took a leap of faith, quit my job
        and enrolled in the greatest coding bootcamp that Florida had to offer: Wyncode Academy.
        It was here that I managed to sublimate my newfound passion into something substantial and 
        become a Full Stack Web Developer.
